# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of Release Helper is a top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

### ⚠️ Please Do NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it's been addressed
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it

### ✅ Please Do:

**1. Report Privately**

Contact us directly at:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/zxcnoname666/release-helper/security/advisories/new) (preferred)
- **Email**: [your-email@example.com] (if you prefer email)

**2. Include Details**

Please provide:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information (optional)

**Example Report:**
```
Subject: [SECURITY] API Key Exposure in Logs

Description:
OpenAI API keys are being logged in plain text when debug mode is enabled,
creating a risk of credential exposure in CI logs.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable debug logging with DEBUG=true
2. Run release workflow
3. Check action logs - API key is visible

Impact:
High - Exposed API keys could be used by unauthorized parties

Suggested Fix:
Mask API keys in all log outputs using GitHub's secret masking feature

Contact: security-researcher@example.com
```

**3. Response Timeline**

We will:
- Acknowledge your report within **48 hours**
- Provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**
- Keep you informed of our progress
- Credit you in the fix (unless you prefer anonymity)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

**1. Secret Handling**
- All API keys are handled as GitHub secrets
- No secrets are logged or exposed in outputs
- GitHub automatically masks secrets in logs

**2. Dependency Security**
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning with Dependabot
- Minimal dependency footprint

**3. Code Security**
- TypeScript strict mode
- No use of `eval()` or similar dangerous functions
- Input validation on all external data
- Safe handling of git operations

**4. API Security**
- HTTPS-only communication
- OpenAI API calls use official SDK
- Rate limiting respected
- No credential storage

### Known Limitations

**OpenAI API Key**
- Required for AI changelog generation
- Stored as GitHub secret (encrypted at rest)
- Never committed to repository
- Transmitted over HTTPS only

**GitHub Token**
- Auto-provided by GitHub Actions
- Scoped permissions (contents: write only)
- Automatically revoked after workflow completes

## 🔐 Best Practices for Users

### Secure Configuration

**1. API Keys**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Use secrets
with:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

# ❌ WRONG - Never hardcode
with:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: 'sk-...'
```

**2. Permissions**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Minimal permissions
permissions:
  contents: write

# ❌ WRONG - Excessive permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
  id-token: write
```

**3. Branch Protection**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Protect release branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# Ensure branch protection rules are enabled
```

### Protecting Your Secrets

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**
1. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as repository secret
3. Never commit secrets to the repository
4. Rotate keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
5. Use read-only tokens when possible

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Don't expose in CI logs
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# ✅ CORRECT - GitHub automatically masks
# (but avoid echoing anyway)
```

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Regular Reviews

We perform security reviews:
- Before each major release
- When adding new features
- After dependency updates
- In response to vulnerability reports

### Third-Party Audits

Currently, no formal third-party audits have been conducted. We welcome security researchers to review the codebase.

## 📦 Dependency Security

### Dependency Management

- **Lock file**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` ensures reproducible builds
- **Updates**: Dependencies updated monthly (or sooner for security patches)
- **Scanning**: Automated scanning via GitHub Dependabot

### Current Dependencies

Core dependencies (production):
```json
{
  "@actions/core": "^1.x",
  "@actions/github": "^6.x",
  "openai": "^4.x"
}
```

All dependencies are from trusted sources with active maintenance.

## ⚡ Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

If a security vulnerability is confirmed:

**1. Assessment (Day 1)**
- Evaluate severity and impact
- Determine affected versions
- Develop mitigation strategy

**2. Fix Development (Days 2-5)**
- Develop and test fix
- Create security advisory (if needed)
- Prepare release notes

**3. Disclosure (Day 5-7)**
- Release patched version
- Publish security advisory
- Notify affected users
- Credit reporter (if desired)

**4. Post-Incident (Week 2)**
- Conduct post-mortem
- Update security practices
- Implement preventive measures

## 📊 Vulnerability Severity

We assess vulnerabilities using CVSS v3.1:

| Score | Severity | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | 24 hours |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | 48 hours |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | 7 days |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | 30 days |

## 🎯 Scope

### In Scope

Security issues in:
- Release Helper source code (`src/`)
- GitHub Actions workflow execution
- API key handling and secret management
- Dependencies and supply chain
